# Instagram Explorer Bot 

The project as a whole is a form of designing an automation bot that is meant to browse through instagram, imitate scrolling actions, be able to select an image, go through a set of images, and search up a person and repeat the same cycle again (which is to scroll, browse, and select image) before returning to the home page.

This project utilized two different dependencies being: web chrome driver and selenium, which are required to run this project.

To be able to run this project:
   - Download chromedriver, unzip, move to ``/usr/local/bin`` (mac OS / linux)  
  
To be able to run this project on windows:
   - After downloading chromedriver, in order to set up the executable path by moving it to the C drive and it will look something like      this : ``C:\ path\ toyour\ chromedriver.``
 
 Make sure you setup a configuration file of sort named as secrets.py  with variables:
 
  `` username = 'your_username'``
  `` password = 'your_password'``
   ``person = 'person_searched_up' ``
    ``PATH = 'C:\path\toyour\chromedriver'`` (this is for windows user)
   
  The person being searched up can be changed. If there are any suggestions, feel free to add that in. 

The project as a whole is a form of designing an automation bot that is meant to browse through instagram, imitate scrolling actions, be able to select an image, go through a set of images, and search up a person and repeat the same cycle again (which is to scroll and browse) before returning to the home page.


Feel free to add more features and/or tweaks to some of the functions to fit what the bot can do for you.

Happy coding!
